#  Patched Sur

Welcome to Patched Sur, a simple but detailed patcher made for Big Sur.

## What is Patched Sur?

Patched Sur is a UI patcher for macOS Big Sur, designed to make it easy to run macOS 11 on unsupported Macs. This patcher hopes to allow any user of any knowledge to patch their Mac, while still giving you freedom on how you want to use your Mac.

## Compatibility
please go to: https://bensova.gitbook.io/big-sur/supported-macs to see if your mac is supported.

## How do I use Patched Sur?

1. Download Patched Sur (.dmg not .zip) from the GitHub releases page.
2. Open the dmg, right click on the app and click open.
3. The first three prompts are just information explaining:
   - A quick intro into Patched Sur
   - How much functionality you will get out of macOS once the patching process is done
   - How the patcher works and what it does to your Mac
4. Next, you can choose what update track you would like to update with. Release is the default (however, it is currently unavailable since macOS Big Sur is not released yet), but you can also choose Public Beta and Developer Beta.
5. Then, you select whether you want to update macOS from Catalina to Big Sur (or Big Sur to Big Sur if you are switching from a different patcher) or do a clean install of Big Sur (currently unavailable).
6. After that, your Mac will start downloading **@barrykn**'s micropatcher for kexts and a couple other resources.
7. Now, you will be able to choose what version of macOS to download. By default it will show the latest version based on your selected release track, but if you click "View Other Versions" you can choose a different one, or your own.
8. Once the download is finished, you need to enter your password so Patched Sur can install the package, then after you select the USB drive you want to use to install macOS, the patcher can copy the installer onto the USB.
9. Finally, the USB gets patched and you are ready to start patching!
10. Reboot your computer and start holding down the option key as soon as your Mac turns on.
11. Select the yellow EFI Boot drive (if there are multiple unplug and replug in your drive and select the EFI Boot that disappeared and reappeared), your Mac will quickly turn off so turn it back on, again holding down option, and select Install macOS Big Sur Beta.
12. Once the installer boots, select reinstall macOS, agree to the Terms and Conditions, then select the drive you want to install Big Sur onto (should be the same drive you ran the patcher on).
13. After the installer is done (it will take a while and appear to get stuck), log in to your Mac and open Patched Sur for your Applications folder or LaunchPad.
14. Open the Patch Kexts section and enter your password, then you should be able to reboot and enjoy Big Sur!

#### How do I choose a my own installer? (v0.0.2+)

To choose a different installer that you already have downloaded, click `View Other Versions` then click `Find an Installer` and navigate to the InstallAssistant.pkg or Install macOS Big Sur Beta.app file you would like to use.

#### How would I update macOS? (Not in current release)

To update macOS, you launch the post-install app then click update macOS, then select the version you want to update to (the latest version should be pre-selected). Once it finishes downloading the package, it will prompt you to insert a USB drive (unless `Install macOS Big Sur Beta` is plugged in, in which will skip the prompt and select that) then copy the installer onto the USB. After that, boot into the installer, and reinstall macOS onto your Big Sur drive. Once that is done you can boot into macOS, rerun the post-install patch kexts tool and enjoy the latest version of Big Sur.
